            <h2 className="coc-heading mono">Why have a Code of Conduct?</h2>
            <p className="coc-text">
              The KiwiHacks community includes people from many different backgrounds. 
              The organizers and contributors of KiwiHacks are committed to providing a friendly, safe, 
              and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, 
              race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.
            </p>
            <p className="coc-text">
              The first goal of this Code of Conduct is to establish a baseline standard of behavior so that 
              people with different social values and communication styles can communicate effectively, 
              productively, and respectfully.
            </p>
            <p className="coc-text">
              The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.
            </p>
            <p className="coc-text">
              The third goal is to ensure our community is welcoming to people from different backgrounds. 
              Diversity is critical for building a thriving hacker community, and KiwiHacks benefits 
              from participants with different perspectives and experiences.
            </p>
            <p className="coc-text">
              A healthy community must still allow for disagreement and debate. 
              This Code of Conduct is not intended to silence differing opinions, 
              but rather to ensure that discussions remain respectful and constructive.

            <h3 className="coc-subheading">Be friendly and welcoming</h3>
            <p className="coc-text">
              Be considerate of others. Remember that people have different communication

            <h3 className="coc-subheading">Be patient</h3>
            <p className="coc-text">
