        <p className="about-text">
          KiwiHacks is New Zealand's first high school hackathon club, running
          hackathons for high school students 18 and under. Our events's are a
          chance to meet new people, learn some new skills, and build something
          you're actually proud of, whether that's an app, game, website, robot,
          or a chair that runs away from you.
        </p>
        <p className="about-text">
          KiwiHacks is run by high schoolers, for high schoolers, meaning every
          site (yes, even this one!), piece of art, event, and everything else
          was made by like minded Kiwi high schoolers who are building a
          community of like-minded Kiwi high schoolers through KiwiHacks!
